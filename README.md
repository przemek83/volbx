## About project
Volbx is a graphical tool used for data manipulation written in C++/Qt. User can:
 * load data - opens XLSX and ODS spreadsheet files,
 * filter data - filters panel can be used to define data range on each column,
 * select data - user can select rows on main data table, 
 * visualize data - multiple types of built-in diagrams  (histogram, grouping, linear regression, quantiles) which adjusts dynamically according to user actions,
 * order data - each column can be ordered ascending or descending, 
 * export data - selected set of data, together with linked plots, can be exported to XLSX spreadsheet file or CSV. 

The tool was originally created for real estate appraisal as it gives the possibility, for people working in that area, to estimate past, current and future value of analyzed properties. When project/start-up was dropped, I've decided to release a less specialized application as an open source project. Most advanced and dedicated for real estates functionalities were cut out, basic and intermediate ones stayed.

## Getting Started
This section describes briefly how to setup the environment and build the project.

### Prerequisites
Qt in version 6.5 or greater, a C++ compiler with C++17 support as a minimum, and CMake 3.16+. 

### Building
Clone and use CMake directly or via any IDE supporting it. CMake should:
- configure everything automatically,
- compile and create binaries.

As a result of compilation, binary for simulations and binary for testing should be created.

**TIP**: Remember to set properly the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` env variable. It should have a Qt installation path to let CMake `find_package` command work.  

**TIP**: Add `qmake` location to `PATH` variable as QWT building expects it.   

## Built with

| |  Windows | Windows | Ubuntu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| OS version | 10 22H2 | 10 22H2 | 24.04 |
| compiler | GCC 13.1.0 | MSVC 19.29 | GCC 13.2.0 |
| CMake | 3.30.2 | 3.30.2 |3.28.3 |
| Git | 2.46.0 | 2.46.0 | 2.43.0 |
| Qt | 6.5.2 | 6.5.2 | 6.5.2 |
| Eible | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 |
| QwtBle | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 |
| Wble | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 |

## Licensing
Volbx is published using LGPLv3 license. 

The project uses the following software and licenses:    
* Qt, Qwt, QuaZip, Eible, Wble and Qwtble libraries - LGPL licenses (more on qt-project.org, quazip.sourceforge.net, qwt.sourceforge.net and github.com/przemek83),    
* Zlib - Zlib license (can be found on zlib.net).

## Updater
1) Build target `VersionCheck`.
2) Run `VersionCheck`.
3) Following window should be shown:    

![Alt text](updateScreen.gif?raw=true "")

## Setup update server
1) Get a domain and hosting :)
2) Create a simple .php file which contains something similar to this:
```
<?
echo("Volbx-Update-Info\n");

echo("1.10");

chdir("current/");
foreach (glob("*") as $filename) {
    echo "\n$filename;" . filesize($filename);
}
?>
```
3) Copy .php file to hosting.
4) Create folder `current` in directory where .php file is located.
5) Add new/other version of Volbx and/or updater in `current` directory.
6) Change code of `Networking` namespace in Volbx to point to proper address. Look for 
`QNetworkRequest Networking::getCurrentVersionRequest()` 
and 
`QNetworkRequest Networking::getDownloadFileRequest(const QString& file)`
7) Compile `VersionChecker` and run it.
8) Application should connect to given address and download content of `current` folder.

**Remarks**:   
- Updater is doing correctness checks using file sizes. Checksums should be used instead.   
- When I've created VersionChecker I've decided to use the simplest known by me solution. I do not know if it is safe and 'proper' enough, but it worked for me. I'm not web developer ;)   
- Windows needs admin rights (as of ~2012) to execute files having in name strings like "update", "install" or "setup". I've picked name `VersionChecker` to work around that problem.   
- On Windows OS, updater cannot overwrite file which are being used (as of ~2012). There is a special mechanism in place for replacing used/locked files: 
    * close Volbx, 
    * run updater, 
    * download files,
    * change not used binaries/libs, 
    * on next run of Volbx replace automatically used/blocked ones.

## Testing
For testing purposes, the Qt Test framework is used. Build the project first. Make sure that the `volbx-tests` target is built. Modern IDEs supporting CMake also support running tests with monitoring of failures. But in case you would like to run it manually, go to the `build/tests` directory, where the‚Å£ binary `volbx-tests` should be available. Launching it should produce the following output on Linux:
Example run:
```
$ ./volbx-tests
********* Start testing of ConfigurationTest *********
Config: Using QtTest library 6.5.2, Qt 6.5.2 (x86_64-little_endian-lp64 shared (dynamic) release build; by GCC 10.3.1 20210422 (Red Hat 10.3.1-1)), ubuntu 24.04
PASS   : ConfigurationTest::initTestCase()
PASS   : ConfigurationTest::testSavingConfigurationFile()
PASS   : ConfigurationTest::testReadingFilledConfigurationFile()

(...)

PASS   : TestConstants::testElapsedTimeToSeconds()
PASS   : TestConstants::testGetProgressBarFullCounter()
PASS   : TestConstants::cleanupTestCase()
Totals: 9 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 blacklisted, 0ms
********* Finished testing of TestConstants *********

```
As an alternative, CTest can be used to run tests from the `build/tests` directory:
```
$ ctest
Test project <path>/volbx/build/tests
    Start 1: volbx-tests
1/1 Test #1: volbx-tests ......................   Passed    0.38 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.39 sec

```

## Potential further improvements
* Upgrade code to use C++20.
* Measure and increase test coverage.
* Setup static analysis (CppCheck, Clang Tidy, Clazy).
